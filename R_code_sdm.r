# R code for species distribution modelling mainly distribution on individuals of a population in space
install.packages("sdm") #species distribution modelling package
library(sdm) #spatial package
# we going to use this for populations' studies: check for single species: individuals from same species
# we use data inside tha package, we do not need to set the working directory since data are already in
library(raster) #predictors: environmental variable - help in predicting species distributions
library(rgdal) #geospatial data abstraction library - species - coordinate data with value (vector data: array of coordinates)

#use of "system.file" function that shows all the files in a certain package called sdm
file <- system.file("external/species.shp", package="sdm") #species data (path, package used and name it) 
#shp extention: shape file-point related to the species(presence-absence)

#explain the name of the file we are taking the files
#path in which we have the data:"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.1/Resources/library/sdm/external/species.shp"
#if we take this path and we put it in our file systems we will find our species data
file #we can see the path -> inside the external folder there are the data
#recreating a shape file inside r with the shapefile function, we are importing this data
species <- shapefile(file) #exactly as the raster function for raster files (correspondence function of raster). These are points(vector of coordinates)

#200 points inside , 1 variable (called occurence: 0 r 1 if you find or not the species)
species$Occurrence #200 occurences with 1 or 0 to each species
#language used for subsetting data
#how many occurrences are there? use [] to make a subset - if you want to subset the occurerences == 1 or 0 (for negative query(!=)
species[species$Occurrence == 1,] #control symbol: used to explain that the query has finished : the comma (,)
#94 are the occurrences = 1
species[species$Occurrence == 0,] #200-94=106
#we can built a new dataframe with only presences assigning it to a new object: -  manner to subset DataFrame

#add to the presences plot also the absences: add additional points to the previous plot - plot together presences and absences

#list files function: list files inside a certain folder (path in our case-external folder) - common pattern for files: asc

#array/vector of methods to usemore methods at once
#the model produced slope and intercept, now we use this model and make prediction: for each pixel what is the probability of presence based on the line(method, prediction)
#corresponding each slope to each predictors -> final prediction of presence of species in space

#predict the speed of spreading of a species in a certain area
#applay the formula y=bx+a starting from the parameters, to the 4 predictors to have the final prediction
#if you make a model than you can make a prediction with this function:
p1 <- predict(m1, newdata=preds) #map probability (prediction)
p1
#explain model we are using. Applay the parameters of the model to predictors
#it is a raster layer. plot the prediction:
plot(p1, col=cl) #preiction of the probability of the presence of species
#goodness of feed: plot the presencies and we can expect that some part of the model will be more or less good.
points(presences, pch=19)
#plot preferences together with p1 with this function to add points into the picture
#we have the prediction of the presence of the species: located in the part of high probability to find it so the model is good
#on the west the model is not in line with original data, we can see some indidivuals: there could be additional predictors important 
#for the species and we are not considering them
#probability of occurrence in the map

#final stack with everything all together

plot(s1, col=cl) 
#now the picture is called model
names(s1) <- c('Elevation', 'Precipitation', 'Temperature', 'Vegetation', 'Probability')

#we can put any names and make any change we wont to rename the pictures
#this type of model can be applied to any variables
